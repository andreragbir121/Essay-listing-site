        <h1 class="essay-title">Health is Wealth</h1>
        <p>The greatest wealth is our own health. A healthy body can earn great wealth but, a wealthy person 
            cannot earn great health. We live in a fast-moving world where individuals have no time for 
            themselves. Most part of their life withers away in search of materialistic wealth in order to outshine 
            others but, along the way, they lose their health.<br>  <br>
            
            Recent studies have shown that the increased stress of the present speedy life is leading to various 
            medical conditions. Major among those are heart and neurological problems. Good health assists an 
            individual to keep a positive attitude toward work and life in general. Wealth matters, but, is not as 
            important as health.<br> <br>
        
            Spending lots of money on junk food in five-star hotels or on other entertainment sources like 
            watching films for a day and so on has no advantages other than self-satisfaction. Being physically 
            and mentally healthy helps an individual to be socially and financially healthy as well. A healthy 
            person can earn lots of money however an unhealthy person cannot because of a lack of motivation, 
            interest, and concentration level.<br> <br>

            Money is the source to carry on with a healthy life however good health is the source of living a 
            happy and peaceful life. So, everyone should take many precautions in maintaining good health. 
            Everyone should be away from bad habits and unhealthy lifestyles. Being healthy isnâ€™t only the 
            condition of being free of disease, ailment, or injury but also being happy physically, mentally, 
            socially, intellectually, and financially. Good health is an actual necessity of happy life and the 
            greatest gift from nature. <br><br>
