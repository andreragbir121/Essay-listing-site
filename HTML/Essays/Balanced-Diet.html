        <h1 class="essay-title">Balanced Diet</h1>
        <p>A diet that contains all kinds of necessary ingredients in almost the required quantity is called the 
            “Balanced Diet”. A Balanced diet is one that helps to maintain or improve overall health. We should 
            consume a balanced diet consisting of essential nutrition: liquids, adequate proteins, essential fatty 
            acids, vitamins, minerals, and calories. We must eat fresh fruits, salad, green leafy vegetables, milk, 
            egg, yoghurt, etc. on time in order to maintain a healthy body.<br>  <br>
            
            Among the minerals, we require chiefly iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and small quantities of 
            iodine, copper, etc. They are found in green vegetables and most fruits, Vitamins have a number of 
            kinds like A, B, C, D, etc. Vitamin A is found in fish oil, butter, carrot, papaya, etc., and Vitamin B is 
            found in green leafy vegetables, wheat grain, etc. Vitamin C is found in green chilli, green vegetables, 
            amla, lemon, and citric fruits. Vitamin D is found in the first oil, butter, and rays of the sun. We also 
            need Vitamins E and K for our health. Milk is perhaps the only single item that can be called a 
            balanced diet in itself. <br> <br>
        
            Animal protein is found in meats, poultry, and fish. The white of an egg also contains protein. 
            Another kind of protein is found in milk (casein), cheese, curd, pulses, soybean, dry fruits, etc. Fat is 
            found in butter, pork, coconut, all edible oils, cod liver oil, the yolk of an egg, etc. We should drink 
            more water at least 7-8 glasses of water. A healthy body also needs some daily physical activities, 
            proper rest and sleep neatness, a healthy environment, fresh air, and water, personal hygiene, etc. <br> <br>
