        <h1 class="essay-title">Noise Pollution</h1>
        <p> Any unwanted loud sound which causes stress and irritation can be termed noise pollution. Of late, 
            sound or noise pollution has adversely affected our normal life in a major way. It is chasing us at 
            almost every step. In schools, colleges, offices, and even hospitals we have an explosion of deafening 
            sound. The main sources of noise pollution are Means of transport, the Use of loudspeakers, the 
            Industrial sector, and the Celebration of festivals and wedding ceremonies. We are almost deafened 
            by the blaring mikes or the record players which are often played at full volume.<br>  <br>
            
            Secondly, we have noise pollution caused by various groups of people shouting out their slogans or 
            impatient automobiles always honking their horns. During some social and religious festivals, 
            crackers are burst indiscriminately. Noise pollution can have serious effects on human health. It may 
            cause impairment of hearing and can cause sleep disruption. People who are frequently subjected to 
            a high level of noise pollution may suffer from hypertension, depression, and panic attacks. It may 
            lead to an abnormal increase in heartbeat and heart palpitation. It can also cause migraine 
            headaches, nausea, and dizziness.<br> <br>
        
            Some Measures to Minimise Noise Pollution are Prohibiting the blowing of horns, The use of 
            loudspeakers should be banned, Airports should be located away from residential areas, and People 
            should restrain themselves from lighting firecrackers. In recent times laws have been passed to take 
            effective steps to control sound pollution. People must also be made aware of the dangers of noise 
            pollution.<br> <br>
