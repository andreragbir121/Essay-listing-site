        <h1 class="essay-title">Co-Education</h1>
        <p>Co-education is a system of education in which boys and girls study together in a common school or 
            college. Co-education was not prevalent in ancient times. It is a groundbreaking thought. Co
            education is exceptionally practical. The number of schools required is less. The strength of the 
            teaching staff is diminished. The government spends less money on infrastructure and laboratories. 
            The balance of money so saved is spent on better maintenance of schools and colleges, which 
            facilitates the students for better study.<br>  <br>
            
            The parents supported the case for adequate education for the children irrespective of their sex. The 
            countrymen realized that the boys and girls have to move together and shoulder to shoulder in every 
            walk of life in the free world. They started educating their children in co-educational institutions. 
            That is the reason why the students of co-educational institutions do better in every walk of their life.<br> <br>
        
            It is useful in producing a sensation of solidarity and a feeling of equivalent obligation among boys 
            and girls. When young boys and girls come closer to each other, they take more care in 
            understanding each other. That helps in creating a friendly atmosphere between the two. The boys 
            and the girls partake in their joint exercises consistently in schools and universities.  <br><br> 
            
            If we want that our country ought to sparkle, we need to bring young boys and young girls together 
            for making a power of working hands in the country, which can give a compelling reaction for 
            greatness by accelerating the advancement in every one of the fields.<br> <br>
