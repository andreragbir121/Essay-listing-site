        <h1 class="essay-title">Value of Time</h1>
        <p>There is a saying, “Time and tide wait for none. The value of time is very great. We can regain lost 
            money and lost health. But lost time is gone forever. So, we should know the use of time. We should 
            remember that we cannot recall the time that is gone. We can stop the clock but we cannot stop the 
            time. And so we must make the best use of every moment. This knowledge and habit of proper use 
            of time are the secrets of success. <br>  <br>
            
            Our life is short. But time passes swiftly. Our life is made of moments. So, to lose a moment is to 
            waste a valuable part of life. By making the right use of the time we can do a lot. We should avail 
            ourselves of every opportunity. If we do not know the use of time our life becomes miserable. We 
            should know that a stitch in time saves nine. Idle time is said to be a thief of time.<br> <br>
        
            If we idle away our time, our appointed work will suffer and success will be hard to achieve. Time lost 
            is lost forever. We are born to do a lot of work. Great men realize it. They never lose a moment. 
            Gandhiji always used to keep a watch to watch his time. He who performs his duties punctually 
            prospers in life positively. What can be done today should not be put off for tomorrow. We should 
            not say ‘later’, we should do ‘now’. <br> <br>
