        <h1 class="essay-title">Water Pollution</h1>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, any foreign matter either natural or other sources which 
            contaminates and pollutes the water or the water supply making it harmful to human and aquatic life 
            is termed water pollution. Household detergents and wastes pollute water bodies. When detergents 
            and fertilizers containing phosphates are discharged into water, it promotes the growth of algae. 
            Drilling oil under the sea may prove dangerous for marine life. <br><br>
            
            Water pollution may severely affect human, plant, and animal life. When contaminated water is 
            consumed, the pathogens enter the human body. It may cause various water-borne diseases such as 
            typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, and jaundice. Metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium 
            dissolved in water may cause several diseases if they enter the human body. When water 
            contaminated with cadmium was consumed by the Japanese, they were affected by a disease called 
            Itai-Itai.<br><br>
        
            Similarly, a disease known as Minamata affected the Japanese after they consumed fish that had a 
            large concentration of mercury. When phosphorus and nitrates from fertilizers are disposed of in 
            water bodies, they promote the growth of algae. The presence of algae in water bodies in a large 
            number reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in water resulting in the death of fish and other 
            water organisms. Thermal pollution increases the temperature of the water which in turn reduces 
            the level of oxygen in the water. This results in the death of many species of fish. Measures should be 
            taken to prevent water pollution before the situation goes out of control. Anti-pollution scientific 
            methods should be devised. <br> <br>
