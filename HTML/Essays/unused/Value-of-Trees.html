        <h1 class="essay-title">Value of Trees</h1>
        <p>Trees are of great importance in our everyday life. They provide us with thatch for huts, timber for 
            buildings and furniture, firewood, food like fruits, honey, etc., and medicine. We are dependent on 
            trees for our very existence on earth. They produce oxygen which keeps us alive. They also absorb 
            carbon-di-oxide exhaled by us and thereby help to create a pollution-free atmosphere. Trees help to 
            prevent the erosion of soil and floods.<br>  <br>
            
            Both the urban and rural people gain advantages from growing more trees. The former enjoys a 
            pollution-free atmosphere and the latter gets fruits, fuel, goods of economic importance, and 
            medicines. Road-side trees are planted to beautify the roads and purify the air. Trees supply fresh air 
            to reduce pollution in urban areas and help in rural economic growth. It is important to note that 
            33% of the land is required as forests in any country to maintain ecological balance. Hence we must 
            take utmost care to grow more trees and stop deforestation. Trees give men shelter and shade. They 
            protect wildlife. Trees help men fight against environmental pollution.<br> <br>
        
            So we all must grow more trees and stop deforestation. We must care for trees for our own sake. We 
            should not forget that the great scientist Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose proved that trees are living 
            beings. The festival, Vano-Mahotsav is observed every year during the rainy season. Thousands of 
            saplings are planted on the occasion. More and more areas are brought under forest cover and 
            people are taught “Plant trees and save a life.” . <br> <br>
